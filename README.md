# 🖥️ Allen's Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website that is made purely with HTML5, CSS and Little of JavaScript!  
This project showcases my skills, projects, and experience as a developer and designer.

## ✨ Features

It’s built with pure HTML and CSS as a way to practice and demonstrate the skills I’m currently learning.

- **Dark Theme** – Clean, modern design with black as the primary color.  
- **Responsive Layout** – Built with CSS flexbox/grid and dynamic units for smooth scaling.  
- **Typography** – Uses modern Google Fonts (`Poppins`, `Archivo`, `Cinzel Decorative`, etc.) with `clamp()` for fluid sizing.  
- **Favicon & Branding** – Custom logo with responsive adjustments.  
- **Projects Section** – Highlights my work, including web systems, designs, and collaborations.  
- **Contact Section** – Easy ways to connect with me.
